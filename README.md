# Project Readme: Music Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview
In this project, we will explore machine learning techniques to build classifiers for determining whether we might like a song based on its attributes, which are provided by the Spotify API. We will use an existing dataset from Kaggle to perform exploratory data analysis and implement various classifiers.

## Project Structure
Throughout the entire series, we'll:

1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and other commonly-used libraries.

2. **Build a Decision Tree classifier** using scikit-learn.

4. **Build an Artificial Neural Network classifier** by leveraging Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Project Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform basic EDA on the song dataset to examine its structure and gain insights into the features provided by the Spotify API.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Implement a Decision Tree classifier using the scikit-learn library to predict song likability based on its attributes.

4. **Neural Network Classifier**
   - Set up a new Jupyter notebook and perform basic EDA on the song dataset.
   - Build classifiers using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to determine song likability based on its attributes.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, we aim to have a comprehensive understanding of how different machine learning models can be applied to classify songs based on their attributes. This will provide valuable insights into the potential for using machine learning in music recommendation systems and related applications.
